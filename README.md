# NavAlone: Memory Aid for Dementia Patients 🌟

Built during **HackHarvard 2023** with the theme **Hack to the Future**.

## 📖 Why We Built NavAlone
We built NavAlone to address the emotional struggles that loneliness, grief, and dementia cause for seniors and their caregivers. Recognizing the deep impact loneliness can have on physical and mental well-being, our mission was to create a practical solution that offers comfort, companionship, and ongoing connections to meaningful memories.

## 💡 What NavAlone Does
NavAlone uses advanced technology to create realistic digital companions modeled after a senior’s loved ones, whether they are living or have passed away. Seniors can chat or talk with these digital companions anytime through web, SMS, or phone calls. Caregivers can upload special memories, allowing dementia patients to relive these moments independently, reducing emotional stress and caregiver burden.

## ⚙️ How We Built It
NavAlone offers two intuitive interfaces:
- **Senior-Friendly Interface:** Built with Next.js, optimized for ease of use.
- **Caregiver Dashboard:** Created using Angular, allowing easy upload of memories and message scheduling.

### Technology Used:
- **Authentication:** Clerk, Firebase
- **Frontend Development:** Next.js, Angular, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Backend & AI Integration:** Langchain.js, OpenAI, ai SDK
- **Data Management:** Pinecone (VectorDB), Upstash (Conversation History)
- **Voice Interactions:** Twilio, ElevenLabs
- **Deployment:** Ngrok

## 🔥 Challenges We Faced
Integrating different frameworks (Next.js and Angular) alongside a static HTML/CSS landing page was challenging. Ensuring smooth communication between these distinct components required significant problem-solving and teamwork, ultimately leading to a unified user experience.

## 🏅 Proud Moments
- Awarded **“Best First-Time Hack”** among 300+ teams for innovative use of technology in healthcare.
- Successfully tackled new technologies, including Next.js and Angular, enhancing our skills substantially.
- Created a meaningful project with clear, real-world benefits for users.

## 🎓 Key Learnings
- Implemented and managed vector databases effectively.
- Enhanced frontend-backend communication through robust API integration.
- Improved collaboration across diverse technological stacks.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
NavAlone was built right after GPT technology became mainstream, and there’s a ton of room for growth. Our immediate goal is to refine the phone call feature, making interactions faster, more realistic, and highly intuitive, particularly for senior users.
