# NevaAlone - Grief and Memory Management for Seniors
NavAlone is a thoughtful project dedicated to supporting our seniors. It addresses common challenges such as loneliness, grief, and dementia. We achieve this by creating AI companions resembling their loved ones, both living and departed.

Our AI companions are available for chat, texts, and calls, ensuring seniors have the companionship they desire. For caregivers of dementia patients, there's a special feature. You can upload memories to the AI companions, easing the emotional burden and sparing dementia patients from recurring grief.
